# VIDIVOX

This is a prototype of Vidivox, a project that was worked on for the University of Auckland Softeng 206 2015 course.

Vidivox is a simple video player that allows the user to add generated speech to a video to create a virtual narration. More features will be added in the final version of Videvox and will be worked on individually by the authors.

## How to run
This java applicaiton was designed to run on Ubuntu 14.04 with JRE 1.8_X installed. The following packages are also assumed to be installed:

1. ffmpeg (latest version)
2. Festival (2.1 or greater)

To run this on a UG4 lab computer (University of Auckland specific requirement) navigate to the directory containing the Vidivox jar file and run the following command in the shell:

`/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.8.0_45/bin/java -jar VIDIVOX.jar`

Note that currently Vidivox can only play mp4 files, not avi files.
